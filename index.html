            <p>
                Calliope is ten years old and she is an American Shorthair. She was found under a shed with her 5 brothers who used to beat her up all the time as she was the runt. I was gifted her and raised her since she was just a kitten. We've been through alot together and she is absolutely obsessed with me.
